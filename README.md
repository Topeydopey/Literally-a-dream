# Literally A Dream
The repository for a small game called Literally A Dream, for archiving purposes after the project concludes.

Literally A Dream is a flatgame that is apart of Assignment 1 for Game Design Class 3 Class in my course. A game where you imagine a cat walking in the scenary as you're sitting in your car, looking out the window. The goofy cat is stomping all the trees and natures, sombody stop him.
